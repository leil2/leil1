			We are gaining a fast understanding of this illness. There is an emerging consensus of 3 possible phases. Patients typically have no symptoms at all during the first stage, the incubation period, they may or may not have detectable virus. Most people recover without making headway. Phase two includes symptoms, not usually serious, the virus should be detectable. Most people are never going to get past this point, and recover. In the third stage, increasingly severe inflammatory or infective symptoms develop, particularly involving the lungs. This results in increased cough and shortness of breath. This stage is associated with heightened viral charge. This stage is associated with an excessive immune reaction in some patients that can lead to a 'cytokine outbreak.' This is an overwhelming internal battle that could result in damage not only to the lungs but also to other organs. Much of the immune response protects blood vessels. Blood vessel immune reaction leads to an increase in blood clotting which plays a role in organ damage within the body. That Kawasaki disease in children was one uncommon but significant example of this phenomenon.

		<h2>What is COVID-19</h2>
		<p>
			'CO' means corona, 'VI' means virus and 'D' means illness. This disease was previously referred to as '2019 novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV.' The COVID-19 virus is a new virus related to the same family of viruses as Extreme Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and other forms of common cold. Fever, cough and shortness of breath can be symptoms. In more severe cases, infection can lead to pneumonia or trouble breathing. More rarely, the illness can be fatal. Such signs are similar to flu or common cold (influenza), which is far more severe than COVID-19. Therefore testing is important to confirm whether anyone has COVID-19. The virus is transmitted by the direct contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets (generated by coughing and sneezing). Individuals may also be infected from virus-contaminated surfaces and touch their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus can live several hours on surfaces but it can be killed by simple disinfectants.
